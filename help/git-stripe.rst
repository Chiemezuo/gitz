``git-stripe``: Push a sequence of commit IDs onto upstream branches
--------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE
=====
.. code-block:: bash

    git stripe [<number-of-commits>] [commit-id]
    [-b/--branch_base=<branch_base>] [-r/remove]

DESCRIPTION
===========

    Starting with a given commit ID, and moving backwards from there,
    push each commit ID to its own disposable branch name.
    
    Useful if CI has missed some of your commit IDs because you rebased or
    pushed a sequences of commits too fast.

EXAMPLES
========

    Assume current branch is master:
    
    git stripe
        Pushes HEAD~, HEAD~2 and HEAD~3 into their own branches named
        _gitz_stripe_master_0, _gitz_stripe_master_1
        and _gitz_stripe_master_2
    
    git stripe --remove
    git stripe -r
        Remove any branches named _gitz_stripe_master_0,
        _gitz_stripe_master_1 and _gitz_stripe_master_2.
    
        git-stripe -d does not fail if some or all of the branches
        to be removed are missing
    
    git stripe --base-branch=BBBB
    git stripe -b=BBBB
        Pushes HEAD~, HEAD~2 and HEAD~3 into their own branches named
        BBBB_0, BBBB_1, BBBB_2
    
    git stripe --count=2 --base-branch=BBBB
    git stripe -c=2 -b=BBBB
        Pushes HEAD~ and HEAD~2 into their own branches named BBBB_0
        and BBBB_1
