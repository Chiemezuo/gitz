ðŸ—œgitz - tiny useful git commands ðŸ—œ
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of little git utilities each of which does one
useful thing well.

Some of them come from scattered open source repositories which I grabbed,
but most of them you see here for the first time.

Some of them are aimed at rapid development on private branches
because they rewrite history extensively, and some are general purpose.
