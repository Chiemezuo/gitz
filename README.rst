ðŸ—œgitz - tiny useful git commands, some dangerous ðŸ—œ
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of eight little git utilities, each of which does one
useful thing well.

Three of them come from scattered open source repositories which I grabbed,
and the other five only exist here.

Half of them are aimed at rapid development on private branches
because they rewrite history extensively.  These are marked as dangerous.

---

``git-amp``
  AMend the last commit message and force-Push, somewhat safely.
  (dangerous)

  Commit your changes with an auto-generated message
  (from https://github.com/moondewio/git-infer)

``git-listall``
  List recent commits for multiple branches

  Renames a git branch _and_ its remote branch.
  (dangerous)

``git-snip``
  Delete one or more commits by commit id or position
  (dangerous)

  Pretty, compact alternative to ``git-status`` (from
