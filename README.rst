ðŸ—œ gitz - git commands for rapid development ðŸ—œ
------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of seventeen git utilities, the majority of which
are aimed at people doing rapid development using Git.

Gitz is for two types of users - quality-obsessed individuals who relentlessly
manicure their pull requests until every byte is in the right place; and
ultra-rapid developers who want to generate large features quickly while taking
advantage of continuous integration.

Most of them only exist here, one comes from other git repos, one came
from a chat on Reddit and I don't know where one of them came from

Four of them are written in Bash, the rest use Python 3.  They have been tested
on Mac OS/X (Darwin) and on Ubuntu, and will likely work on any Unix-like
operating system.

How to install
==============

Using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install gitz

Otherwise, download and uncompress
`this directory <https://github.com/rec/gitz/archive/master.tar.gz>`_,
then put that downloaded directory's path into the ``PATH``
environment variable.

Getting help
============

Below there's a summary of each command, and a link to a manual page.
Or from the terminal, use ``-h`` flag like this: ``git new -h``.


When to use gitz
=================

1. At the start of a session

   - ``git new`` safely creates fresh branches from upstream
   - ``git update`` for each branch, rebases from upstream and pushes

2. During development

   - ``git st`` is a more compact and prettier ``git status``
   - ``git ls`` shows you when documents were last changed

3. During rapid development

   - ``git amp`` amends and force-pushes the message of the last commit -
     great for minor spelling mistakes
   - ``git infer`` commits files with an automatically generated message -
     great for committing tiny changes for later rebasing down

4. While cleaning commits for release

   - ``git shuffle`` shuffles and removes commits in the current branch
   - ``git split`` split one or more commits, perhaps with the staging area,
     into many small individual commits, one per file

5. During branch maintenance

   - ``git rotate`` rotates through all branches
   - ``git copy``, ``git delete``,  and ``git rename`` work both remotely and
     locally

6. Working with continuous integration

   - ``git stripe`` pushes branches with a sequence of commits
     to a remote where CI can find and test them

The gitz commands
-----------------


Safe commands
=============

Informational commands that don't change your repository

`git gitz <doc/git-gitz.rst>`_
  Print information about the gitz git commands

`git infer <doc/git-infer.rst>`_
  Commit changes with an automatically generated message
  
  (from https://github.com/moondewio/git-infer)

`git multi-pick <doc/git-multi-pick.rst>`_
  Cherry-pick multiple commits, with an optional squash

`git new <doc/git-new.rst>`_
  Create and push new branches

`git rotate <doc/git-rotate.rst>`_
  Rotate through branches in a Git repository

`git st <doc/git-st.rst>`_
  Colorful, compact git status

`git stripe <doc/git-stripe.rst>`_
  Push a sequence of commit IDs to a remote repository

`git when <doc/git-when.rst>`_
  When did each file change (date, commit, message), or
  
  Dotfiles are ignored by default

Dangerous commands that delete, rename or overwrite branches
============================================================

`git copy <doc/git-copy.rst>`_
  Copy a git branch locally and remotely

`git delete <doc/git-delete.rst>`_
  Delete one or more branches locally and remotely

`git rename <doc/git-rename.rst>`_
  Rename a git branch locally and remotely

By default, the branches ``develop`` and ``master`` are protected -
they are not allowed to be copied to, renamed, or deleted.

You can configure this in three ways:

- setting the ``--all/-a`` flag ignore protected branches entirely

- setting the environment variable ``GITZ_PROTECTED_BRANCHES`` overrides these
  defaults

- setting a value for the keys ``PROTECTED_BRANCHES`` in the file
.gitz.json in the top directory of your Git project has the same effect

Dangerous commands that rewrite history
=======================================

Slice, dice, shuffle and split your commits.

These commands are not intended for use on a shared or production branch, but
can significantly speed up rapid development on private branches.

`git adjust <doc/git-adjust.rst>`_
  Amend any commit, not just the last

`git amp <doc/git-amp.rst>`_
  AMend the last commit message and force-Push, somewhat safely

`git save <doc/git-save.rst>`_
  Save and restore state of the git repository

`git shuffle <doc/git-shuffle.rst>`_
  Reorder and delete commits in the current branch

`git split <doc/git-split.rst>`_
  Split a range of commits into many single-file commits

`git update <doc/git-update.rst>`_
  Update branches from a reference branch

Dangerous commands that are janky
=================================

``git-all`` is something I use all the time, but it only works in
simple cases, and I don't see a good path to making it do complicated
things in a sane way.

`git for-each <doc/git-for-each.rst>`_
  Perform a command for each branch or directory
