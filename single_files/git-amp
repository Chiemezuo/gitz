git-amp: AMend the last commit message and force-Push

    Excellent for fixing a spelling mistake you just made and pushed to
    a private branch.

    For your protection, git amp will fail with a message if there are any
    changes in your workspace which would get accidentally mixed into the
    previous commit.

    git-amp rewrites history.
    Do not use on any production, public or shared branch.

USAGE:
    git amp Your new commit message here
    git amp "It's a commit message! (fix #12?)"

(You need quotes if the message includes special shell characters like
#, ', ", *, ?, !)
